cybersec - a lot to memorise but syllabus is quite easy, considered the easiest ETC by most, many common-sense questions are asked

industry 4 - same as the above except for last point

drone tech - also considered one of the easiest ETC's, topics are quite interesting to learn

global climate change - less syllabus but very strict correction

blockchain - requires memorization, but the topics are pretty boring. pick this one if you want to take up blockchain in the future

bioinspired - take if you're in biotech and are interested in it

renewable energy - somewhat easy apparently

nanotech - not particularly good, teacher is mid and gives quizzes only in offline mode

iot - they say this one's the hardest

semiconductor - pretty hard

embedded - also hard, but interesting topics
